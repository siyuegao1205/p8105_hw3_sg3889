## Data Description

The `instacart` dataset contains 1384617 observations of 131209 unique
users from the “train” evaluation set, with 15 variables, primarily
describing information about Instacart online order usage. Some key
variables in the dataset are as follows:

-   `user_id`: user identifier
-   `product_id` and `product_name`: product identifier and name of the
    product, respectively
-   `aisle_id` and `aisle`: aisle identifier and name of the aisle,
    respectively
-   `department_id` and `department`: department identifier and name of
    the department, respectively
-   some variables related to the `order`, such as:
    -   `order_id`: order identifier
    -   `add_to_cart_order`: sequence of each product being added into
        cart in each order
    -   `order_number`: order sequence for each unique user
    -   `order_dow` and `order_hour_of_day`: time that the order was
        placed on
    -   `days_since_prior_order`: days since the last order

To give an illustrative example of the order NO.1 in this dataset:

``` r
instacart %>% 
  filter(order_id == 1)
## # A tibble: 8 × 15
##   order_id product_id add_to_c…¹ reord…² user_id eval_…³ order…⁴ order…⁵ order…⁶
